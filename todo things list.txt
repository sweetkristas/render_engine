TODO LIST
========================

List of things still needed to be done, not in any particular order.

* Implement a texture registry and system for re-building textures if the context is lost.
* Implement surface or image caching, using filename as a key.
* Re-think the way render variables work. 
* Add ways to specify different techniques for implementing things, so we can fallback if the hardware doesn't support a required feature.
* Add a 2D canvas for drawing simple textures, such as might be used with UI elements.
* Add a way to convert a surface to a different format (such as might be used if 16bpp is enabled).
* Auto-convert surfaces to 16bpp if use_16bpp() is enabled in window manager (textures should just magically work now :) )
* Add a way to specify a custom conversion function when converting a surface to a different format. -- may need to be templated?
* set_window_icon/set_window_size/auto_window_size/change_fullscreen_mode need still to be implemented.
* Need to add an fbo class and a way of changing the window render target to the fbo.
* Finish implementing packed YUV texture support.
* Finish implementing cubic texture support.
* For planar YUV textures in PIXELFORMAT_YV12, need to swap V/U planes when rendering.
* Fix lighting. 
* Add material over the top of textures.
* Useful things on texture units: http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/manual/manual_17.html#Texture-Units
* Implement the an Abstract factory design for all the DisplayDevice and WindowManager backends.
