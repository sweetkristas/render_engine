TODO LIST
========================

List of things still needed to be done, not in any particular order.

* Add ways to specify different techniques for implementing things, so we can fallback if the hardware doesn't support a required feature.
* Auto-convert surfaces to 16bpp if use_16bpp() is enabled in window manager (textures should just magically work now :) )
* Add a way to specify a custom conversion function when converting a surface to a different format. -- may need to be templated?
* set_window_icon/set_window_size/auto_window_size/change_fullscreen_mode need still to be implemented.
* Finish implementing packed YUV texture support.
* Finish implementing cubic texture support.
* For planar YUV textures in PIXELFORMAT_YV12, need to swap V/U planes when rendering.
* Fix lighting. 
* Add uniform blocks (with hardware backing)
* Useful things on texture units: http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/manual/manual_17.html#Texture-Units
* Add instancing support see: http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/billboards-particles/particles-instancing/
* Make some sort of framework for universal shaders.
* Make it so that if addressing modes other than clamp are used or mipmapping is enabled then we only use power-of-two textures.

Finished things

* -Add material over the top of textures.-
* -Implement the an Abstract factory design for all the DisplayDevice and WindowManager backends.-
* -Re-think the way render variables work.-
* -Need to add an fbo class and a way of changing the window render target to the fbo.-
* -Add hardware buffers for storing render variables.-
* -Implement surface or image caching, using filename as a key.-
* -Add a way to convert a surface to a different format (such as might be used if 16bpp is enabled).-
* -Implement a texture registry and system for re-building textures if the context is lost.-
* -Make sure uniform color is always set to "white" in the shader if it isn't used.-  -- Worked around this.
* -Add a 2D canvas for drawing simple textures, such as might be used with UI elements.
* -Add SVG support.
